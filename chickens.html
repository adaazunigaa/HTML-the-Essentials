<h1>Chcickens</h1>
<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domegit sticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red 
    junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for 
    an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that 
    has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a 
    sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens 
    were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries 
    BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food 
    (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, 
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[3] up from more
         than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than 
         any other bird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – 
         in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>
